  Manually refresh the wiki hot cache (hot.md) by reading recent wiki activity and

# wiki-hot

Read `skills/wiki-schema/SKILL.md` fully before proceeding.

Both forms invoke this skill identically:
- Claude Code: `/wiki-hot`
- Copilot: `wiki-hot:`

## Step 1 — Resolve VAULT_PATH

Vault path: `~/obsidian_vault` by default; set `VAULT_PATH` to override. WSL users with a Windows-side vault must set `VAULT_PATH` explicitly (e.g. `/mnt/c/Users/<name>/obsidian_vault`).

---

## Step 2 — Read recent activity

1. Read the last 10 entries of `Knowledge/wiki/_log.md` (top of file — newest first).
2. Read `Knowledge/wiki/_index.md` to understand current wiki scope.
3. For any pages created or updated in the last 3 log entries: read those pages.

---

## Step 3 — Write hot.md

Overwrite `Knowledge/wiki/hot.md` completely with a fresh summary following the format
from `wiki-schema`:

```markdown
---
type: meta
title: "Hot Cache"
updated: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS
---

# Recent Context

## Last Updated
YYYY-MM-DD. [One sentence: what the most recent wiki activity was]

## Key Recent Facts
- [Most important recent knowledge in the wiki]
- [Second most important]
- [Third, only if genuinely significant]

## Recent Changes
- Created: [[list of recently created pages]]
- Updated: [[list of recently updated pages]]
- Flagged: [any unresolved contradictions or open issues, or "none"]

## Active Threads
- [Current research topic or work in progress, based on log]
- [Open question not yet resolved, or "none identified"]
```

Constraints:
- Total file length: ≤300 words. Cut ruthlessly.
- Focus on what is most likely to be useful at the start of the next session.
- Do not narrate the full log history. Synthesise.

---

## Step 4 — Append to _log.md

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] hot | manual refresh
```

---

## Finish

```
Hot cache refreshed. Knowledge/wiki/hot.md updated (YYYY-MM-DD).
```
